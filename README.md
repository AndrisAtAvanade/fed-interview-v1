# Technical interview for Front-end developer

This test aims to see your approach to different front-end tasks, implementation style, and rationale.     
The test doesn't have an end aim and is built around discussion and how far we can go in a limited amount of time.

To start, please clone this application on your local machine and run `npm install` and `npm start`.   
You should see on your http://localhost:3000/ an app with a single button.

Please browse the app with your favourite IDE and get familiar with the files.   
Also, there is only one component with a corresponding SCSS file.

To give you a head start, please think about how you would create ten buttons.   
How about ten buttons in ten rows? Can you adjust the styling accordingly?   
Can we make a dropdown to change the number of buttons per row and amount of rows?   
Those are indicative questions, and tasks might be slightly different on the test day.

# Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can't go back!**

If you aren't satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you're on your own.

You don't have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn't feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn't be useful if you couldn't customize it when you are ready for it.
